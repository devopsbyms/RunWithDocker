# RunWithDocker

## Docker Containers in GitHub Actions
    - You can run jobs inside Docker containers instead of the default virtual environment.
    - This is useful when you need a specific environment (e.g., Python 3.8, Node.js 16, or custom tools).
    - Use pre-built container images from Docker Hub or other registries.
    - Use custom images with your configurations.



## When to Use Docker Containers?
    - Custom Environments: If your application requires specific dependencies not available on default runners.
    - Consistency: To ensure that workflows behave identically across different environments.
Testing Docker Images: If you want to test your own Docker images or multi-container applications.
